# MurkWallpaperManager
a better version of the wallpaper manager from murkmod

**WARNING:** _This is just a test and may be buggy or possibly not work, we are not responsible for anything that may happen to your device._

-If your computer is managed, there's a good chance you have a policy called "Device Wallpaper" or something similar to that, that specific policy allows your administrator to control your Device Wallpaper, to be more specific, whenever you click the sign out button on a chromebook, or restart it, after it boots, it will want you to login into an account, and if your computer is managed, you will probably have a wallpaper that shows its managed by your school, think of it as a way for your local IT Admin to check if your computer is managed if they ever want to inspect your chromebook. If you don't have a wallpaper it will just show a blur of your wallpaper you have on whatever account you want to login to.

-Your probably using this because you just un-enrolled your chromebook and used something like MurkMod and want to make it look like your chromebook is managed by your school or just want a different background. 

-Since this "policy" is managed through firmware and your device, unlike other polices, this may not work on a normal computer that isnt managed or doesnt have a school account associated with the device, it's best to use something like MurkMod before using this so you can enroll your chromebook but keep it in a developer mode state while also having access to different "utilities".
